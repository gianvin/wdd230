                            <strong>Pyrotechnics</strong>
                            <p>Bulacan is noted as a leading manufacturer of pyrotechnics in the Philippines. It is
                                estimated
                                that about 500 manufacturers are producing pyrotechnic products, particularly
                                concentrated
                                in
                                the areas of Bocaue, Santa Maria, Baliuag, and other neighboring municipalities of the
                                province.
                                Some of them have already joined the Macau International Fireworks Display Competition.
                            </p>
                            <p>Manufacturers and dealers grew rapidly in Bulacan relatively because of the high profits
                                generated. It is important to note that the number of players in the industry varies
                                with
                                the
                                season that usually dictates market conditions. Demand for pyrotechnics is closely
                                related
                                to
                                the general economic health of the country. On average, May and December are peak months
                                because
                                of fiestas, Christmas, and New Year's Eve celebrations. It was observed that high
                                economic
                                growths result in higher demands for pyrotechnics during these months.</p>
                            <p>It is Santa Maria that hosts most of the pyro-manufacturing factory but Bocaue became the
                                center
                                of trade due to its strategic location.
                                Baliuag, San Rafael, San lldefonso, Norzagaray and Angat also host Pyrotechnic
                                enterprises.
