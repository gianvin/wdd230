            <h3>Major Industries in Bulacan/h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jewelry Inductry</li>
                    <p>The industry of jewelry in Bulacan is in the city of Meycauayan, there are about 2,000 jewelry
                        manufacturers in the province. A local association, the Meycauayan Jewelry Industry Association,
                        Inc. (MJIA), was formed 1985 to oversee and assume the lead role in the development of the
                        jewelry inductry in the province. The MJIA has grown from an original membership of 37 to the
                        current 106. </p>
                    <li>Furniture Industry</li>
                    <p>Bulacan is the home of some furniture products manufacturers producing a wide range of
                        world-class furniture. Catering to both foreign and domestic markets, they manufacture simple,
                        classic and reproduction furniture made of wood, rattan, metal, and mix of these materials.
                        Their manpower is highly-skilled in fine and elaborate wood carvings, stone parquetry, carabao
                        bone in-laid furniture.</p>
                    <p>At present, Bulacan exports fine furniture primarily to Europe, Middle East, Korea, Taiwan,
                        Mexico and U.S. territories.</p>
                    <li>Pyrotechnics</li>
                    <p>Bulacan is noted as a leading manufacturer of pyrotechnics in the Philippines. It is estimated
                        that about 500 manufacturers are producing pyrotechnic products, particularly concentrated in
                        the areas of Bocaue, Santa Maria, Baliuag, and other neighboring municipalities of the province.
                        Some of them have already joined the Macau International Fireworks Display Competition.</p>
                    <p>Manufacturers and dealers grew rapidly in Bulacan relatively because of the high profits
                        generated. It is important to note that the number of players in the industry varies with the
                        season that usually dictates market conditions. Demand for pyrotechnics is closely related to
                        the general economic health of the country. On average, May and December are peak months because
                        of fiestas, Christmas, and New Year's Eve celebrations. It was observed that high economic
                        growths result in higher demands for pyrotechnics during these months.</p>
                    <p>It is Santa Maria that hosts most of the pyro-manufacturing factory but Bocaue became the center
                        of trade due to its strategic location.
                        Baliuag, San Rafael, San lldefonso, Norzagaray and Angat also host Pyrotechnic enterprises.</p>
